Implementation of 4 different scheduling algorithms:
(1) First Come First Serve
(2) Round Robin - with a quantum of 2 cycles - FCFS for preemption/blocking
(3) Uniprogrammed - 1 process at a time regardless if the process is blocked or not, otherwise FCFS
(4) Shortest Job First - FCFS for blocking


To Compile: javac Main.java
To Run: java Main [flag] [inputfile]

[flag]: --verbose if you would like verbose output (java Main --verbose input1)
[inputfile]: the argument for the input file containing the processes (java Main input1 => no verbose)

NOTE: the online input files have been included for convenience (input1...input7)

WARNING: the "random-numbers" file must be included in the directory since it is hardcoded.
	 Alternativley if a new random numbers file is provide it must be in the same directory
	 under the same format and must be called "random-numbers" or the program will generate
	 a null pointer exception.
