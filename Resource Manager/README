Implementation of two different resource managers:
(1)An optimistic manager which grants all resources a process asks for in a FIFO manner. 
If deadlock occurs the algorithm chooses the next process in the queue to abort. 

(2)An implementaiton of Dijkstra's Banker algorithm. The manager only grants resources to a process only if
granting these resources will lead to a safe state, in this way completley avoiding deadlock. 

to compile:
   make

to run:
   ./main [input file]

note the input files from the web have been included for convenience

arbitrary limits:
	  total number of instructions per task = 25
	  total number of tasks = 10
	  total number of resources = 10
