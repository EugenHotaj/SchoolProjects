<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>

<p>For the final project, I would like to implemnt something relativley simple in scope but which I think would look really cool and let me explore a topic we haven't really talked about in class, namley particle effects.</p>

<p> 
I would like to create a randomly generated fireworks display scene in VR. I did something similar in <a href="../hw6/index.html">HW6</a> in which I built a firework cannon using a very silly particle generator where each particle was simply a tiny, colored square.

This time however I would like to procedurally generate the particles (possibly using Perlin Noise) so as to get a more realistic effect. 
As mentioned, I plan to incorporate some aspect of VR into this project. My initial idea is to position the "player" in the middle of the scene 
and have fireworks randomly go on around him. The "player" can then look around using a VR headset. Since the player is stationary and only head tracking is required, any VR headset will do, such as Google Cardboard. 

<p>
One challenge of this project is to make the particles behave like firework, meaning I would possibly have to incorporate some type of gravity or basic physics into the scene. 

<p>
Even though the idea is simple, I think it will be an enjoyable display for the viewer, if exceuted correctly.
